Data - this is the subfolder where I save any files that I need to read into R in order to do my analysis or visualisation. These could be anything from SPSS (*.sav) files, Excel / CSV files, .FST or .RDS files. The key idea is that these are source data files, and at no point should R be saving over or editing these files in order to ensure reproducibility. The reasoning is that reproducible analysis isnâ€™t really possible if the source data file keeps getting changed by the analysis (think analysis in spreadsheets). If you do need to change the source data file, create a new version and ensure that the new file name appropriately reflects that change.
