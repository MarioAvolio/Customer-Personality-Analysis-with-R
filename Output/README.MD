Output - Save all your outputs here, including plots, HTML, and data exports.

- Having this Output folder helps others identify what files are outputs of the code, as opposed to source files that were used to produce the analysis.
- What you have set up as the sub-folders don’t matter too much, as long as they’re sensible. You may decide to set up the sub-folders so that they align with the analysis rather than type of file export.
- The timed_fn() function from my package surveytoolbox (available on GitHub) helps create timestamps for file names, which I use often to ensure that I don’t lose work when I am iterating analysis.
